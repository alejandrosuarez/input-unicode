# input-unicode
Simple Automator workflow to generate characters from unicode hex.

Inspired by http://granjow.net/unicode-input.html for Windows.

This simple workflow allows you to input a Unicode character using its hex code.

If you double-click on the work flow, it will add it to your services, so it will be available from your Services submenu, typically in the Application menu. It may also appear when you right-click somewhere, but not in every application.

You will then get an input box like this:

THe above sample will give you: èŒ¶ðŸ¦§

I find it useful to create a universal short cut

ï£¿ | System Preferencesâ€¦ | Keyboard | Services | Text | Input Unicode

You will see that itâ€™s written in JavaScript because I find it easier to use than AppleScript.
